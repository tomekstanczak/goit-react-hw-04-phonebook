Refactored Functional React Phonebook App

This project is an evolved version of a phonebook application in React, initially developed during a code course utilizing class-based components. In this refactored iteration, the application has been redesigned using functional components and hooks, showcasing a modern and concise approach to React development. The refactoring process involved transitioning from class-based state management to utilizing React hooks, such as useState and useEffect.
Technologies Used:

    React
    PropTypes
    nanoid for generating unique IDs
    Local storage for data persistence
    React hooks (useState, useEffect)

Key Features:

    Add and delete contacts
    Filter contacts by name
    Local storage for data persistence
    Prevention of duplicate contacts
    Functional component and hooks-based architecture

Refactoring Highlights:

This project represents a significant refactoring effort from a class-based component structure to a functional component and hooks-based architecture. The transition enhances code readability, maintainability, and aligns with modern React best practices. The refactoring process underscores the adaptability and scalability of the application, providing a valuable learning experience for developers exploring different coding paradigms within the React ecosystem.
